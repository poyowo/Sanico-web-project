        <h4>I'm Marco "poyo" Sanico, an 18 year old computer freak from the Chicagoland area with undying passion and dying work ethic.<br></h4><p style="line-height: 2.5em">
            I'm often busy with making stuff like this, playing obscure videogames (especially fighting games), or drawing when I should more productive.
            Being born in the big '07 allowed me to grow up alongside a fledgling world-wide-web with just about all the side effects you'd expect,
            each Minecraft lets-play, Flipnote Hatena, and overseas memetic sensation that somehow ended up in my YouTube recommended compounding into the person before you who made such a goofy website.
            In all honesty, I couldn't thank the internet enough for the passive yet powerful role its played in my life, introducing me to new horizions like this and expanding my worldview tenfold.
        </p><p style="line-height: 2.5em">
            Having been an honors academic whose flame burnt out way too soon, I naturally picked up a ton of hobbies and interests that will never fully be realized, but still entertain me all the same.
            When I was younger I was absolutely obsessed with the idea of making my own videogame and while that obsession certaintly hasn't gone anywhere, it's led to greater avenues and is widely why 
            this site exists in the first place. In a similar vein, I've been all over the place creatively, finding a place in myself as a traditional artist, creative writer, amateur graphic designer,
            and "aspiring" voice actor, though even I know that its too much a pipe dream to ever see fruition.</p>
        <h4>"okay enough with the sappy stuff what fighting games do you play"</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 2.5em;float:left"">
            FINALLY A GOOD QUESTION; but seriously
